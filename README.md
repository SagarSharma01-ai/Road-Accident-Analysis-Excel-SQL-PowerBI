## 1. Project Objective
This project analyzes road accident data from 2021 and 2022, covering a total of **417,883 casualties**. The goal was to identify primary risk factors (Road Type, Vehicle Type, Environment) and recommend strategies to reduce fatalities.

---

## 2. Tools Used (Full Stack Approach)
To ensure accuracy, the analysis was performed across three platforms:
- **Microsoft Excel:** Analyzed the full historical dataset (2021-22 combined) for high-level trends.
- **SQL:** Used for data cleaning, date standardization, and validating Year-over-Year (YoY) growth logic.
- **Power BI:** Created an interactive dashboard focused on Current Year (2022) trends and granular filtering.

## 3. Key Findings & Visualizations

#### 1. Performance Overview (YoY Trend)
Road safety improved in 2022. Total casualties dropped by **11.9%**, and fatal casualties saw a massive reduction of **33.3%**.

#### 2. The "Car" Dominance
**Cars** are responsible for nearly **80%** of all casualties across both years.

#### 3. Infrastructure Risk
**Single Carriageway** roads are the deadliest, accounting for the vast majority of accidents compared to Dual Carriageways.

#### 4. Myth Buster: Environmental Factors
Contrary to popular belief, **73.8%** of accidents occur in **Daylight** and **61.9%** happen in **Urban** areas. Visibility is less of a factor than traffic density.

## 4. Recommendations
1.  **Infrastructure:** Allocate budget to improve safety barriers on **Single Carriageway** roads.
2.  **Enforcement:** Shift patrol focus to **Urban areas during Daylight hours** rather than just night patrols.
3.  **Awareness:** Launch targeted campaigns specifically for **Car Drivers**, as they represent the highest risk group.
